Goal for this page: 

To let the user upload a file (Paperclip)

To have a model that has users able to have multiple files, and show them. (Scribd_fu)
Easily upload a file, know its relation to user (Devise)
To create a randomized refrence, and make it sharable
decouple from my computer (git, heroku, S3)
Display the files on the web


This is my first rails app. I'll take any feedback.

Thanks!
Vik
